  <h3>Angular JS</h3>
<p>AngularJS (commonly referred to as "Angular.js" or "AngularJS") is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web application
    framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges
    encountered in developing single-page applications. The JavaScript components complement Apache Cordova, a framework
    used for developing cross-platform mobile apps. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications
    by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along
    with components commonly used in rich Internet applications. In 2014, the original AngularJS team began working on the
    Angular application platform.</p>
  <p>The AngularJS framework works by first reading the HTML page, which has additional custom tag attributes embedded into
    it. Angular interprets those attributes as directives to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented
    by standard JavaScript variables. The values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code, or retrieved
    from static or dynamic JSON resources.</p>
  <p>According to JavaScript analytics service Libscore, AngularJS is used on the websites of Wolfram Alpha, NBC, Walgreens,
    Intel, Sprint, ABC News, and about 12,000 other sites out of 1 million tested in October 2016.[3] AngularJS is currently
    in the top 100 of the most starred projects on GitHub.[4]</p>
  <p>AngularJS is the frontend part of the MEAN stack, consisting of MongoDB database, Express.js web application server framework,
    Angular.js itself, and Node.js server runtime environment.</p>
